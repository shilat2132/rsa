# RSA Turing Machine Simulator

This project implements the **RSA cryptosystem** using **Turing machines**, offering a unique perspective on cryptographic computation.  
It simulates **three main machines**:

- **Key Generation Machine** ‚Äì Generates RSA keys (`n`, `a`, `b`) step by step.
- **Encryption Machine** ‚Äì Encrypts a given message using the public key.
- **Decryption Machine** ‚Äì Decrypts the ciphertext using the private key.

All numbers are represented in **binary** on the tapes, and the machines run using low-level state transitions.

## üéØ Motivation

This project demonstrates that a complete RSA encryption/decryption pipeline can be expressed and executed entirely with Turing machines.  
It is both a **theoretical exploration** and a **practical educational tool** to better understand the fundamentals of computation and cryptography.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Three core Turing machines** for RSA: key generation, encryption, decryption  
- **Nested submachines** ‚Äì complex operations (like modular exponentiation) are broken down into smaller machines  
- **Interactive Web Interface** ‚Äì built with **React** to visualize the step-by-step execution  
- **Backend with Django** ‚Äì sends execution steps in chunks for smooth playback  
- **Controls** ‚Äì Play, Pause, Step Forward, adjustable speed
